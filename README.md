Fun
=======

Mini-projects I do for fun. Please see each directory [there's only one lol] for 
information about what's contained in it.

If there are bugs, feel free to open an issue. Please keep in mind, however,
that there are, have been, and forever will be 0 people who actually depend on
this code in any sort of production-like environment. :)
